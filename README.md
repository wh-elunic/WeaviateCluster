## Features

- **Shards & Nodes**: 
   - View shard details across nodes as well as node details.
   - Update read-only shards to READY status (‚ö†Ô∏è Admin API-Key required).
- **Configurable Local Connections**:
   - Customize the URL for local Weaviate instances instead of being limited to localhost:8080.
   - Connect with or without authentication based on your Weaviate configuration.
- **Collections & Tenants**: 
   - Aggregate and view collections and their tenants.
   - Delete collections and tenants (‚ö†Ô∏è Admin API-Key required).
        - Batch deletion support for multiple collections or tenants.
- **Collections Configuration**: Explore collection configurations.
- **Schema**: Fetch and view the schema configuration of your Weaviate cluster.
- **Statistics**: Analyze cluster synchronization and node statistics.
- **Metadata**: View cluster metadata & modules.
- **Consistency**: Analyze shards for inconsistency.
- **Read Repair**: Force repair collection objects inconsistency across the nodes.
- **Object Operations**:
   - Fetch object data in collections.
   - Analyze consistency of an object across nodes (currently hardcoded for a max of 11 nodes).
   - Fetch object data in tenants.
- **Multi-Tenancy Operations**:
   - Visualize tenants and their states.
- **Collection Data**:
   - Read and get all your objects data from a collection/tenant in a table.
   - Download the data locally in a `.csv` file.

## Configuration

### How to Run It on Your Local Machine

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip installed

**Steps to Run**

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeaviateCluster.git
    cd WeaviateCluster
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

If you haven't already created a `requirements.txt` file, here's what it should look like:

```text
streamlit
weaviate-client
requests
pandas
```

Or You can also run the Weaviate Cluster using Docker. Follow the steps below to build the Docker image and run the container:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeaviateCluster.git
    cd WeaviateCluster
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t weaviateclusterapp:latest .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 --add-host=localhost:host-gateway weaviateclusterapp
    ```

This will start the Weaviate Cluster, and you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

### How to Run It on a Cloud Cluster

1. Provide the Weaviate endpoint.
2. Provide the API key.
3. Connect and enjoy!

### Notes

This is a personal project and is not officially approved by the Weaviate organization. While functional, the code may not follow all best practices for Python programming or Streamlit. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: While this tool is designed for cluster operation and analysis, there is always a possibility of unknown bugs. However, this tool is intended for read-only operations.
